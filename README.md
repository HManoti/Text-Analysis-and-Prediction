# Text-Analysis-and-Prediction
This Streamlit-based web application performs text analysis and prediction, allowing users to input text, receive real-time analysis and categorization. It uses Hugging Face's transformers library for sentiment analysis and Scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer for keyword extraction.
When users input text and click the "Run" button, the application analyzes the sentiment of the text and extracts key terms, displaying the sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) with confidence scores and a list of important keywords.
